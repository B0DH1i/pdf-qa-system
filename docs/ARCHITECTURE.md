# PDF Question Answering System - Architecture

This document describes the architecture, components, and workflow of the PDF Question Answering System.

## System Overview

The PDF Question Answering System is a web-based application that allows users to upload PDF documents, process them, and ask questions about their content. The system uses natural language processing and vector embeddings to understand the content of documents and provide accurate answers to user questions.

## Core Components

The system is built using a modular architecture with the following core components:

### 1. Interface Layer

- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface built with FastAPI that allows users to upload documents and ask questions.
- **API**: A RESTful API that exposes endpoints for document management and question answering.

### 2. Processing Layer

- **Document Processor**: Handles the extraction of text from PDF documents and splits them into manageable chunks.
- **Text Processor**: Processes text by cleaning, normalizing, and preparing it for embedding.
- **Entity Extractor**: Identifies and extracts named entities and other important information from the text.
- **Language Detector**: Identifies the language of documents and questions for proper processing.

### 3. Storage Layer

- **Document Store**: Manages the storage of original documents and their metadata.
- **Vector Store**: Stores the vector embeddings of document chunks for similarity search.
- **Metadata Store**: Manages additional information about documents and their content.

### 4. Inference Layer

- **Embedding Model**: Converts text into vector representations (embeddings).
- **Question Answering Model**: Processes questions and retrieves relevant information from the vector store.
- **Response Generator**: Formats and presents answers to the user.

## Data Flow

### Document Upload and Processing

1. A user uploads a PDF document through the web interface.
2. The Document Processor extracts text from the PDF and splits it into manageable chunks.
3. The Text Processor cleans and normalizes the text chunks.
4. The Entity Extractor identifies important entities and concepts in the text.
5. The Language Detector identifies the primary language of the document.
6. The Embedding Model converts each text chunk into a vector embedding.
7. The Vector Store saves these embeddings along with their source metadata.
8. The Document Store saves the original document and its metadata.

### Question Answering Process

1. A user submits a question through the web interface.
2. The Language Detector identifies the language of the question.
3. The Embedding Model converts the question into a vector embedding.
4. The Vector Store performs a similarity search to find chunks of text that are most relevant to the question.
5. The Question Answering Model processes the question and the retrieved text chunks to generate an answer.
6. The Response Generator formats the answer, including relevant context and source information.
7. The formatted answer is returned to the user through the web interface.

## Component Details

### Document Processor

The Document Processor is responsible for:
- Parsing PDF files using PyPDF2/pdfminer.six
- Extracting text content from PDFs
- Handling different PDF formats and structures
- Splitting documents into appropriate chunks based on semantic boundaries
- Preserving metadata like page numbers and sections

### Text Processor

The Text Processor performs:
- Text cleaning (removing extraneous whitespace, special characters)
- Normalization (standardizing text format)
- Tokenization (breaking text into tokens)
- Handling multilingual text
- Identifying sentence and paragraph boundaries

### Vector Store

The Vector Store provides:
- Efficient storage of vector embeddings
- Fast similarity search capabilities
- Filtering based on metadata
- Management of document-embedding relationships
- Uses ChromaDB as the underlying storage engine

### Embedding Model

The Embedding Model:
- Converts text to high-dimensional vector representations
- Captures semantic meaning of text
- Supports multiple languages
- Uses state-of-the-art transformer-based models
- Efficiently handles context windows of appropriate size

## Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Embedding Models**: Sentence Transformers / HuggingFace Transformers
- **PDF Processing**: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six
- **NLP Processing**: SpaCy, NLTK
- **Language Detection**: langdetect
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage**: Local filesystem for documents, ChromaDB for embeddings

## Scalability and Performance

The system is designed with the following scalability considerations:

- **Document Processing**: Document processing is implemented with asynchronous operations to handle multiple uploads concurrently.
- **Vector Search**: The vector store is optimized for fast similarity search, with indices for efficient retrieval.
- **Modular Design**: Components are decoupled, allowing for easy replacement or scaling of individual parts.
- **Stateless API**: The API is designed to be stateless, facilitating horizontal scaling.

## Extensibility

The system can be extended in several ways:

- **Custom Embedding Models**: Additional embedding models can be integrated by implementing the ModelInterface.
- **Alternative Vector Stores**: The VectorStore interface allows for easy integration of alternative vector databases.
- **Additional Document Types**: The document processing pipeline can be extended to support other document formats.
- **Custom Entity Extractors**: Domain-specific entity extractors can be added through the plugin system.

## Deployment Architecture

For production environments, the system can be deployed as:

1. **Monolithic Deployment**: All components run on a single server (suitable for smaller deployments).
2. **Microservices Deployment**: Each component runs as a separate service, communicating via APIs.
3. **Containerized Deployment**: Components packaged in Docker containers, orchestrated with Kubernetes.

## Future Architecture Considerations

- **Distributed Vector Store**: For handling larger document collections
- **Caching Layer**: To improve performance for frequently asked questions
- **Authentication and Authorization**: For multi-user environments
- **Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure**: For system health and performance monitoring
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on system load and user demand

## System Requirements

- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended for production use
- **RAM**: Minimum 8GB, 16GB+ recommended for larger document collections
- **Storage**: Depends on the volume of documents, minimum 20GB recommended
- **GPU**: Optional, but recommended for faster processing with larger models

## Development Guidelines

- **Code Structure**: Follow the modular architecture pattern
- **API Design**: RESTful API design with clear contracts
- **Testing**: Unit tests for core components, integration tests for workflows
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation for APIs and components
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for APIs and components

## Experimental Components: src/models Directory

The codebase contains a `src/models` directory that is not currently used in the active system but represents an experimental prototype for future architectural transitions. This section explains the purpose of this directory and its potential future use.

### Current Status

The `src/models` directory contains several advanced modules:

- **Model Configuration** (`base/config.py`): Defines model parameters and settings
- **Model Management** (`base/manager.py`): Coordinates different model components
- **Graph Neural Networks** (`neural/graph_neural_network.py`): Implements graph-based representation of document content
- **Online Learning** (`neural/online_learner.py`): Provides continuous learning capabilities from user interactions

While these components are documented and referenced in the project structure, they are currently not integrated into the active codebase. The current implementation uses a more direct approach with the DocumentProcessor, TextProcessor, and VectorStore components.

### Future Potential

These experimental modules represent a potential future direction for the system's architecture, offering:

- **Enhanced Understanding**: Graph structures could model relationships between concepts within documents
- **Adaptive Learning**: Online learning would allow the system to improve based on user feedback
- **Centralized Management**: The Model Manager would facilitate integration of different components

### Why Not Currently Used

These modules are not currently used for several reasons:

1. **Experimental Stage**: They are still in the testing and development phase
2. **Complexity vs. Benefits**: The current vector-based approach provides sufficient results for most use cases while being simpler
3. **Resource Requirements**: Advanced models like graph neural networks require more computational resources

### Potential Integration Path

As the system matures and user needs evolve toward more sophisticated features, these components could be gradually integrated into the application. Currently, they serve as a roadmap for future architectural changes, awaiting full development and testing before production implementation.
